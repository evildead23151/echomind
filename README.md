# EchoMind: Your AI-Powered Voice Journal

![EchoMind Banner](https://place-hold.it/1200x600/8A2BE2/FFFFFF?text=EchoMind&fontsize=110)

**EchoMind is a voice-first journaling application that transforms your spoken thoughts into structured, searchable, and insightful notes. It's built for capturing fleeting ideas, daily reflections, and brainstorming sessions without ever touching a keyboard.**

This project is more than a simple transcriber; it's an experiment in creating a more natural and intelligent interface for personal knowledge management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- An account with [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) to get a free API key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/evildead23151/echomind.git
    cd echomind
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`.
    -   This file will store your secret API keys and is ignored by Git.
    -   Add your AssemblyAI key to the file:
        ```
        # File: .env
        ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_goes_here"
        ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    -   Start the Expo development server:
        ```
        npx expo start
        ```
    -   Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device.

The app should now be running on your phone, connected to the development server.
